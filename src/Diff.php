   * Algorithmica, 1(1-4), p251-266. doi: 10.1007/BF01840446
   *
   * In short:
   * - think of the problem as an edit graph: the X axis is the original
   *   sequence and the Y axis is the desired sequence
   * - increasing X is deleting an item (cost 1)
   * - increasing Y is inserting an item from the target sequence (cost 1)
   * - if the items are the same, increase both X and Y simultanously (cost 0)
   * - diffing is now graph traversal problem: find the path with the
   *   lowest-cost cost path from (0, 0) to (len(a), len(b))
   *
   * The paper first defines an edit distance function, then explains how to
   * convert this function into a diff algorithm; in summary:
   *
   * 1) create an edit distance function
   * 2) change it to log all what edits it makes
   * 3) when it's found the minimum edit distance, stop
   * 4) post-process the log into a set of moves
   *
   * The final step is handled by `backtrackPath()`
